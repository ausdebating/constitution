Right of appeal of disciplined member

Register of Associated Groups
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


#. The Secretary of the Association must establish and maintain a register of associated institutions, and their debating groups.

   #. In this section, "debating group" may be taken to be any organised group of students associated with that institution, who participate in and/or run debating tournaments.
   #. In this section, a "title or office" of a debating group shall be taken to be a position created within that group held by one member, with some specific responsibility within that group.

#. The Register shall contain such details as the Secretary sees fit, but must include:


   #. The name of the institution,
   #. The name of the debating group,
   #. Contact details for that instituion's debating group, if they are available.
   #. The title or office of the person who shall act as that group's representative member.

   #. the Committee determines the title or office within that group which shall entitle it's holder to Representative Member status.
   #. the Committee has determined the group is the best representative of a distinct institution.

      #. Where multiple groups wish to claim association, the Committee shall decide which are eligible to be associated.

   #. the Committee has provisionally admitted the institution to membership for one year, or that institution was represented at a vote to create an unincorporated body that was registered as this Association.

#. Where doubt arises about what constitutes a distinct 'institution' or 'debating group', the Committee may construe this as they wish, but should do so with reference to the existance of:


   #. A substantially different university administration or student organisation, and a distinct identity.
   #. A separation by significant geographical distance, such that attending another group's events would involve a considerable amount of travel.
   #. A different degree-awarding institution.
   #. Previous decisions of the Committee regarding the construction of what is an 'institution'.

#. Should a member of the Association feel that the Committee has improperly exercised their discretion in subsections 1 through 4 of section 13, a motion at a general meeting, carried by a two-thirds majority, may override their decision.


Representative Members

   #. Cease to be a member of the Association; or
   #. Cease to hold the office which made them eligible to apply for Representative Membership; or
   #. Fail to pay the fee for representative membership (or obtain an exemption) as required by the Committee, subject to this constitution.

Application for Representative Membership
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Where an eligible member of the Association also holds the office listed in the Register for a given group, that member may apply to the Secretary to be given the status of "Representative Member" of that group.
#. The Secretary will then certify that the applicant does hold that office.

   #. Should the Secretary not be able to certify that person is eligible for Representative Membership; they shall refer the question of certification to the Committee for a vote.

#. If there has ever been a Representative Member of that group, and that member did not pay any fees required of them, the applicant shall be required to pay that fee before assuming Representative Membership.
#. Should a previous Representative Member for that group have paid the fee for Representative Membership in the Association's current financial year, the applicant will not be required to pay that fee again for the current financial year.
   
#. When the Secretary or Committee have certified that a person is eligible for Representative Membership, and that person has paid any fees required of them, that person shall become a Representative Member.

Delegation of Voting Rights
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Representative Members may delegate their voting rights, in writing, or by virtue of the policy of the debating group they represent, so long as:

   #. That Representative member remains both in their office, and a member of the Association; and
   #. The delegate is also a member of the debating group whose representation is being delegated; and
   #. The delegate is eligble to vote in the assocation (particularly, that they be at least 18 years of age); and

#. Delegation of voting rights shall not cause delegation of Representative Membership.
