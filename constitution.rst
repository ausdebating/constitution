Right of appeal of disciplined member

   #. the representative members present are to vote by secret ballot on the question of whether the resolution should be confirmed or revoked.

#. The appeal is to be determined by a simple majority of votes cast by representative members of the association.


Register of Associated Groups
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


#. The Secretary of the Association must establish and maintain a register of associated institutions, and their debating groups.


   #. In this section, "debating group" may be taken to be any organised group of students associated with that institution, who participate in and/or run debating tournaments.
   #. In this section, a "title or office" of a debating group shall be taken to be a position created within that group held by one member, with some specific responsibility within that group.

#. The Register shall contain such details as the Secretary sees fit, but must include:


   #. The name of the institution,
   #. The name of the debating group,
   #. Contact details for that instituion's debating group, if they are available.
   #. The title or office of the person who shall act as that group's representative member.

#. The debating group of any tertiary education institution in Australia shall be on the register of associated groups, provided:


   #. the committee determines the title or office within that group which shall entitle it's holder to Representative Member status.
   #. the committee has determined the group is the best representative of a distinct institution.

      #. Where multiple groups wish to claim association, the committee shall decide which are eligible to be associated.

   #. the committee has provisionally admitted the institution to membership for one year, or that institution was represented at a vote to create an unincorporated body that was registered as this Association.

#. Where doubt arises about what constitutes a distinct 'institution' or 'debating group', the committee may construe this as they wish, but should do so with reference to the existance of:


   #. A substantially different university administration or student organisation, and a distinct identity.
   #. A separation by significant geographical distance, such that attending another group's events would involve a considerable amount of travel.
   #. A different degree-awarding institution.
   #. Previous decisions of the committee regarding the construction of what is an 'institution'.

#. Should a member of the association feel that the Committee has improperly exercised their discretion in subsections 1 through 4 of section 13, a two thirds majority of Representative Members may override their decision.


Representative Members
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Where an eligible member of the association also holds the office listed in the Register for a given society, that member may apply to the secretary to be given the status of "Representative Member".
#. Where that group has not already had a representative member pay a membership fee in the Associations current financial year, the Secretary shall impose a 50$ Representative Membership fee on that person.
#. On payment of that fee, that member shall become a "Representative Member" for a period not exceeding one year.
#. Should they continue to hold the office after that year, they may reapply to the Secretary, and pay that fee again.
#. Representative members may delegate their voting rights, in writing, or by virtue of the policy of the debating group they represent, so long as:

   #. That Representative member remains both in their office, and a member of the association.
   #. The delegate is eligble to vote in the assocation (particularly, that they be at least 18 years of age).
